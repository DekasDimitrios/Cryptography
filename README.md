# Cryptography

## About

The code in the current repository was developed as a part of the "Foundations of Cryptography" undergraduate course that took place during the 6th semester at the School of Informatics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It consits of a plethora of cryptographic algorithms and methods implemented using Python 3.8.

## Main Functions

Every .py file in this repository consists of a main function that can be used to execute a toy example of the code developed, in an attempt to give a better understanding. 

## Dependencies

In order to execute the code of this project, the following Python 3.8 libraries are required:

- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
